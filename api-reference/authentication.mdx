## Authentication

MailPigeon API uses token-based authentication. A token is generated for you when you create a
new project. You can find your token in the **Code** tab of your project.

```js
'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_api_token>'
```

### Permissions

Token generated have write permissions by default. This enables you to collect submissions. It is important that you keep this private so as not to allow people collect submissions to your project
