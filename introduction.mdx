## Why

For the longest time, form submissions have been a pain to collect. You either had to use a third-party service, or build your own backend to collect and store the data. With MailPigeon, you can collect form submissions without any backend code.

## Getting Started

MailPigeon is designed to be easy to use regardless of the project. After
Setting up your fields all it takes is an http request to collect your data.

We also have SDKs available to ease the process of collecting data.
